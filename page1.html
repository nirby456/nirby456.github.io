		<font color="white"><p> Following a less-than-successful run with the PlayStation 3, Sony was determined to correct its mistakes and release a console with the mass appeal of the PlayStation 2, which remains the best selling console of all time, and increased power and more features.<br>
Sony focused on controller improvements, social features that let gamers stream and share gameplay plus functionality to let people play games remotely. 
<br>	
As with any new console, the PS4 offered better processing and graphical capabilities, but it also brought a number of cool features to the table.

Controllers are rechargeable and feature a share button that allows you to upload gameplay and screenshots.The DualShock 4 has Wii-like motion tracking and also has a light bar on top that can change color with gameplay.

Smartphones, tablets, and the handheld PlayStation Vita console can talk to the PS4 console and control certain features like media. What's more, Remote Play is available for all PS4 games, so you can play full PS4 games on the Vita anywhere in the world, while the console does all the processing from your living room.</p> </li>
