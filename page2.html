		So Microsoft created DirectX, a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that made it easy for game developers to work with Windows. It debuted in September 1995 as the Windows Games Software Development Kit (SDK) and later became integral to Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT. But developers stayed away from Windows, believing the platform couldn't be trusted. Microsoft threw a Roman-themed game developer conference in 1996 to convince them otherwise. It helped turn the tide.<br>
In fact, it worked so well that by 1998 Microsoft decided to build an entire game console around DirectX. A four-man team formed out of the DirectX team created the device, then called DirectX Box. Considering how bad the last American-created game console—Atari Jaguar—did in the market (sales were crushed by the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1995), Microsoft's decision to go console was a brave move by a company known for software, not hardware.<br>
		
The goal was based in part on a typical Microsoft strategy: seeing someone else do something successful, mimicking it, and hopefully crushing the competition at its own game. This time it hoped to crush Sony, poised to announce the PlayStation 2 in March 1999. Bill Gates, then chairman of Microsoft, was quoted in Upside saying, "Our game designer likes the Sony machine," when asked about the Sega Saturn. And if Gates thought it worked, he'd go after it.<br>

The four men on the DirectX Box team (Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase, and Otto Berkes) went to work disassembling Dell laptops and constructing a "console" to play games. They got Ed Fries, the head of Microsoft's game publishing division, on board as well. By late 1999 Gates was talking a lot about the console—dubbed Xbox after taking a hint from market testing.The Xbox One is Microsoft's 8th-generation videogame console and follow-up to the original Xbox and Xbox 360. It was released on November 22nd, 2013 in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, UK, and the USA. 
<br>
In September 2014 it launched in additional markets including Argentina, Belgium, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UAE
